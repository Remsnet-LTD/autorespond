Rate-limited autoresponder for qmail

This is a simple program to automatically respond to emails.

It is based on some ideas (but little or no code) from a similar
autoresponder by Eric Huss <e-huss@netmeridian.com>, and ideas presented
in the qmail mailing list.

Features:
- Limits rate of automatic responses (defaults to a maximum of one
  message every hour).
- Will not respond to nearly every type of mailing list or bulk email.
- Will not respond to bounce messages or MAILER-DAEMON.
- Bounces looping messages.
- Can insert the original subject into the response.
- Can copy original message into response.
- Can use links in the rate-limiting data directory to limit inode usage
  to a single inode.

Installation:

- Make sure the latest version of bglibs from
  http://untroubled.org/bglibs/ is compiled and installed.
- Build the sources by running "make"
- Run the "instshow" command to see what will be installed (optional).
- After the package has been compiled, run the following commands as root:
	./installer
	./instcheck
  These commands will produce no output if there are no errors.

Usage (file-based):

Put "|qmail-autoresponder DIRECTORY" into your ".qmail" file before
other delivery instructions.  DIRECTORY is the directory into which
rate-limiting information will be stored, and is expected to contain a
"message.txt" file containing a pre-formatted response (including
headers).  Any instance of "%S" in the message file will be replaced
with the original subject.

Usage (MySQL):

Put "|qmail-autoresponder USERNAME DOMAIN" into your ".qmail" file
before other delivery instructions.  All data (including the message)
will be pulled from the MySQL table.  See schema.mysql for a table
schema.  This program reads MySQL options from the "qmail-autoresponder"
group.  If $MYSQL_USER, $MYSQL_HOST, $MYSQL_PASS, $MYSQL_DB, or
$MYSQL_SOCK are set, they override the defaults in the MySQL
configuration file.  The parameters "USERNAME" and "DOMAIN" are used as
keys into the MySQL tables.  DOMAIN may be replaced with "$HOST", and
USERNAME may be replaced with "$EXT", "$DEFAULT" or "$USER" depending on
the installation (quoting is required).
