Rate-limited autoresponder for qmail

This is a simple program to automatically respond to emails.

It is based on some ideas (but little or no code) from a similar
autoresponder by Eric Huss <e-huss@netmeridian.com>, and ideas presented
in the qmail mailing list.

Features:
- Limits rate of automatic responses (defaults to a maximum of one
  message every hour).
- Will not respond to nearly every type of mailing list or bulk email.
- Will not respond to bounce messages or MAILER-DAEMON.
- Bounces looping messages.
- Can insert the original subject into the response.
- Can copy original message into response.
- Can use links in the rate-limiting data directory to limit inode usage
  to a single inode.

Usage:

Put "|qmail-autoresponder MESSAGE_FILE DIRECTORY" into your ".qmail"
file before other delivery instructions.  MESSAGE_FILE is a
pre-formatted response, including headers, and DIRECTORY is the
directory into which rate-limiting information will be stored.  Any
instance of "%S" in MESSAGE_FILE will be replaced with the original
subject.
